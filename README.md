# String-Pattern-Matching-Algorithm

The program enable simple search for pattern in a given input text. It performed by implementaion of a dictionary-matching algorithm that locates elements of a finite set of strings (the "dictionary") within an input text. It matches all patterns "at once", so the complexity of the algorithm is linear in the length of the patterns + the length of the searched text + the number of output matches.
